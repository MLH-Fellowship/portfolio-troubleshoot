# Week 8 Activity

We've made another copy of the portfolio site, but there are a few issues with it preventing it from running. Can you find the ~12 problems and resolve them? The aim is to be able to deploy the website and access it from the virtual machines IP address without error. If you're unsure, ask your Pod Leader for help.

These errors could include typos or incorrect syntax for example. Using the skills you've learnt to deploy your own flask website, you should be able to fix them all!

**Top tip:** _remember to check the logs for errors!_


## Usage

1. Install docker and docker-compose
2. Create a `.env` file using the `example.env` template
3.
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up
    ```
